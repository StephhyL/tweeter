# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. 

#### Please note: 
- This project incorporates HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for front-end, and Node and Express for back-end.
- It also incorporates responsive web design to display the web layout dependent on the user's screen size.
- The template for this repository was forked from Lighthouse Lab's tweeter starter code. 
This repository, though not intentional, is also a template.
